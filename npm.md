# NPM - Node Package Manager

A great reference: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/

NPM is like pip for python or gem for ruby.


## Hands on

```
$ mkdir my_project
$ cd my_project/
$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
