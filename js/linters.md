# Linters and Formatters

## Prettier

https://prettier.io/

Awesome formatter out there. Code how ever you want and let prettier take care of the formatting of the code. It's very opinionated so that you don't have to be. Supports many languages:

- JS/JSX/TypeScript
- JSON
- HTML
- CSS
- Markdown

Install it in your favorite editor by following instructions [here](https://prettier.io/). I recommend vscode [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). Extreme version: you can set `editor.formatOnSave` to format on save.

Equivalent to [black](https://github.com/psf/black) in the python world.
